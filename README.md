## Digital Agriculture App Requirment
Need to develop an app that offers common functionality for digital agriculture apps (such as OAuth-based Single Sign-On, properties, seasons, field records, etc). The API is built on HTTP and is mostly RESTful: It has predictable resource URLs, returns HTTP response codes to indicate errors. It also accepts and returns JSON in the HTTP body

<br/>

## Description
The application consists of an API and a database designed specifically for Digital Agriculture App. Developed in Node.js, it uses Sequelize to model data efficiently. It follows the MSC (Model-Service-Controller) architecture and REST standard principles.

To ensure the security of information, all CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations are preceded by JWT token authentication. This means that the user needs to provide correct credentials to perform an operation, thus maintaining the integrity of the data.
